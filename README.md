## Overview

The application allows the group of people to pick the music, allowing
all listeners to have a say in what’s playing.  The application
broadcasts the list of songs in a library, allowing nearby users to make
requests, upvote, and downvote songs.  The broadcasting device
consolidates this information, using it to choose which songs to play.
This product can be used in a variety of situations; we currently
imagine it being used in smaller environments within a house or an
apartment, but in the future, we are going to expand it to make it
practical for use at organized events (like prom) or by independent
radio DJs.
