# "iTunes DJ"

## Overview

An iOS app that automates playing music for a group.  The main purpose of the
app is to allow a host to broadcast a library of songs that listeners can
request from using their own devices.  The app then queues songs based on the
number of requests and creates a mix of songs for the party in real time.
